# Problem 1
	- It uses binary search to solve the problem
	- Time complexity: O(log n)
	- Space complexity: O(1)

# Problem 2
	- It uses binary search to solve the problem
	- Time complexity: O(log n)
	- Space complexity: O(1)

# Problem 3
	- It uses quicksot to sort the array 
	- Time complexity: O(n log (n))
	- Space complexity: O(1)

# Problem 4:
	- Sorts the array in sngle traversal
	- Time complexity: O(n)
	- Space complexity: O(1)

# Problem 5:
	- The complexity of creating a trie is O(W*L), where W is the number of words, and L is an average length 	of the word: you need to perform L lookups on the average for each of the W words in the set

# Problem 6:
	- Time complexity: O(n)
	- Space complexity: O(1)
